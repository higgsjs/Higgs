Features we want for the 3rd gen Higgs JIT:
- Incremental compilation, incremental inlining
  - Local profiling during compilation
  - Leaner stubs for unexecuted blocks
- On-the-fly register allocation
- Property access optimizations
- Better deferring of type tag and constant writing
- Some kind of type propagation
- JIT return address objects
- Interpreter-to-JIT entry points on branch edges, not blocks

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Loop opts

For loops, if we could know how many times some type test is run inside the
loop, could hoist tests before the loop, propagate info.

For objects, arrays, can see how many times we test and match on their types,
request that info be propagated.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lazy JIT, what are the fundamental goals?
- Less code compiled
- More incremental compilatiion
- Better profiling
- Eliminating more type tests

Good ideas so far:
- Local inlining
- Local profiling of branches, calls
- Propagating constants
- Occasional forward tracing of information?
- Requests for information based on frequency of usage

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tracing

Backwards tracing might work better than forward. Locate the hot type tests and
trace until they are hit again (full circle), then either remove the test or
hoist it, if it makes sense. There are going to be fewer hot tests than facts
we might want to propagate.

The problem with tracing, however, is that if the information is used a long
time in the future, or comes from a long time ago (e.g.: we are in the middle
of a loop), there might not be too much we can do. With loops, we want to
try and establish invariants before entering.

Still, if we're in a loop, and we require some fact to be propagated, can
compile new code, info will be propagated forward after first iteration, or
before the loop. Ideally though, we want type tests to be placed intelligently,
some basic IR analysis might be required.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Deep Interprocedural IR (DI2R)

Could we have the interpreter build a giant interprocedural IR?
- Keep track of current block, current caller context
- Issue: some specific cases, like deep or broad recursions might just be too big
  - Could keep track of how deep we're expanding specific call sites, allow max depth of 2 or 3
  - Could disallow recursive expansion of call sites

In theory, this is very powerful. Can access stack frames deep down if desired.
Can propagate type information and constants deeply, analyse the entire interprocedural CFG.
- May have invariants become invalid, however? If new callee propagated, for example

If we reach max depth on some call site, need to call into a block with some generic context.

If we have a giant incremental CFG we're building, our predecessors (to backpropagate to)
are obvious, can explore the graph back to them, tell them to propagate what they know.

Backwards propagation of info: start with just one version of a block, a function, anything ***
- If some type test doesn't always come out the same, propagate a request for specialization backwards
- Whoever branches to this block, if they have a constant type for that variable, should duplicate the successor version ***
- Propagate further with each execution? Should slowly duplicate blocks

If we have recursive functions, have some generic version that connects to many
different call site blocks at once. The graph stops being "tree-like" with
respect to deep recursive calls.

Backwards prop of info... Compiling backwards is rather problematic seeming

In theory: some facts are established once, reused many times after

It's maybe not that crazy to think we could do a short interpreter tracing pass
for each fact we establish, to determine its usefulness. Interpret forward until
we run into a type test, check the execution frequency of the type test thus
far in some global ranking (sorted linked list of tests with counts?) Note that
if a type test just started to happen, it won't be important yet. Possibly could
inform the type test of who has impact on it, so that it can request the
information later.

Alternative approach, backwards prop... Could locate hot type tests, trace until        <====
we hit that same type test again, then go backwards in the trace to see if we can
find where this info was established. Otherwise try to find infrequent location
where we could place another test (move the test back?). Need some kind of relative
measure of hotness. Blocks can have exec counts, but also maybe timestamps of when      <====
they were first executed.

Does this all boils down to moving type tests backwards in time, out of hot paths?
With an interprocedural CFG, this could be easier. Explore backwards for locations
to hoist the tests to. Try to avoid expensive code duplications.

Problem: deep interprocedural IR might just be too large? If some function is
called in 200 places, duplicated 200 times. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

May want to keep function IR intact, but create new interprocedural CFG IR
- Add new blocks/versions as needed

When jumping to entry of inlined function, can possibly treat this as just a
jump to a local block. The new version of the inlined block has to operate on
its inputs as they are mapped on the stack. Temporaries that do not yet exist
could possibly be lazily mapped on the stack frame. If we use liveness info
or some kind of interference test, can probably reuse slots and avoid growing
the frame in most cases. Functions could have a reserve of slots to really
minimize frame growth operations.

Perhaps a generic approach is just to have customized entry blocks for all functions with
contexts that have a lot of information. ***
- Include constants in there too

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Backward propagation seems problematic, won't lead to inlining?

- Want to expand our CFG when sufficient execution occurs

Ideally, want to propagate important facts only
Can do this based on profiling + backwards prop of info requests

Possibly, can trace execution in interpreter for a bit?
Say I have a fact, an important piece of information, can we trace it forward?
- Seems impractical

Ideally, record traces periodically?
- Some branch is executed often, wants to know if x:int or !(x:int)
- Wait until some trace hits us
- Go backwards through trace until a point where we know the info we want (if we can find one)
  - Tell that point in the program that it should propagate this info forwards
- If we can't find a point where we know x, could request some test be placed at
  a sufficiently rarely executed boundary site
  - Gain information by testing

Possibly, we can know who our predecessor blocks are in terms of execution context?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What about a simpler approach?

Can profile type tests in general, see which info is most often requested
- If we often have tests for kinds of objects that encounter objects of type
foobar, then we probably want to propagate that some variable is an object of
type foobar. But propagate how far? Can get very large CFGs!
