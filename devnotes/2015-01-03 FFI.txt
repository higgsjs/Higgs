Current FFI is modeled after luaJIT FFI and Python's cffi
http://luajit.org/ext_ffi.html
- missing ffi.new()

What does the FFI do?
- Parses cdecl blocks
- Function wrappers
- Representation of C type decls
- Wrappers to access structs, strings, unions, enums, pointers

ffi.new('type'):
- creates obj of given type
- can use types defined in cdecl
  - local to its own FFILib

C decl parsing seems fairly complex, needs detailed look

May want better template strings, to implement new FFI lib
