TODO: blog post about typed shapes, quick illustrations
- quick sketching program, online?

TODO: study shape implementation in FF, look at slides, look at source

TODO: think about shapes more
- want a guaranteed minimum object size
  - no need for a special ext table, can use objects as is with len, next ptr
- how complicated would they be to implement in a basic form?
  - switch to shape idx
- how much simplification could you get on object property accesses?
  - sketch it out
- can use shape pointers directly
  - shapes can keep list of referring blocks
- start writing D code for shapes
  - class ObjShape
- no more "make_map"
- getters/setters
- no more "missing" value?
- array elem prop

TODO: move stack resizing code to function entry

TODO: eliminate CallCtx, use IRFunction
- simplify design

TODO: eliminate double function entry point
- makes for redundant code, poor design

TODO: look into JSBenchmark
Quicksort, Factorials, Conway, Ribosome, MD5, Primes, Genetic Salesman,
Arrays, Dates, Exceptions
