- BBV branching w/ shapes (added later?)
- What happens when shapes change from setProp?

Base shapes:
- Should have a base shape with a proto property for objects
  - All objects start from this shape
  - Can have IR instr to get this shape id, or constant?
    - Just use getPropIdx("__proto__");
- Base shape for functions
  __fptr__

function $rt_newObj(mapPtr, protoPtr)
{
    // Allocate the object
    var objPtr = $rt_obj_alloc($OBJ_NUM_SLOTS);

    // Initialize the object
    $rt_obj_set_shape(objPtr, $OBJ_NEW_SHAPE_IDX);
    $rt_set_prop_word(objPtr, $OBJ_PROTO_SLOT_IDX, $ir_get_word(protoPtr));
    $rt_set_prop_type(objPtr, $OBJ_PROTO_SLOT_IDX, $ir_get_type(protoPtr));

    return objPtr;
}

getProp:
- No more fetching the capacity
- Compare prop idx with some constant object size
- No more "is missing". If a prop gets deleted, property index is automatically -1

$ir_shape_prop_idx(obj, propStr, create)
- can be like a call, shifts us to a different version where we know the
  shape associated with obj

ISSUE: getters/setters
- For getters/setters, return the property value as normal, and then test it...

function $rt_objGetProp(obj, propStr)
{
    // Find the index for this property
    // shifts us to a different version where we know the shape associated
    // with obj. Implements "inline caching". "version cache"
    var propIdx = $ir_shape_prop_idx_get(obj, propStr);

    // FIXME: must return closure? alloc two slots?
    var propVal;
    if (propVal = $ir_shape_get_prop(obj, propIdx))
    {
        // Property was found, is not a getter
        return propVal;
    }

    // There will be a getter/setter type tag for those objects
    if (isGetSet(propVal))
        return propVal();

    // Get the object's prototype
    var proto = $rt_getProto(obj);

    // If the prototype is null, produce undefined
    if ($ir_eq_refptr(proto, null))
        return $undef;

    // Do a recursive lookup on the prototype
    return $rt_objGetProp(
        proto,
        propStr
    );
}

TODO: object extension, extended table logic
- Could conceivably be handled by the VM

function $rt_objSetProp(obj, propStr, val)
{
    // Find the index for this property
    // Handles inline caching and version dispatching
    // May do a shape transition if the property doesn't exist? ***
    // - probably shouldn't do shape transition in same IR instr, adds complexity
    // Hence, this gets the current shape and a matching property index,
    // may also transition the object to a new shape
    var propIdx = $ir_shape_prop_idx_set(obj, propStr);

    // Hidden inside set_prop, we handle the extended table
    // We may also transition the object to another shape depending
    // on the current type of the property and so on
    //
    // If the current shape is unknown, complex logic will be handled in D
    //
    var setter;
    if (setter = $ir_set_prop(obj, propIdx, val))
    {
        // Property is a setter
        setter(val);
    }
}

ObjShape implementation
-----------------------

At first, need no special changes to BBV. Typed shapes can exist without BBV
exploiting it. Need to start by putting ObjShape, obj alloc system in place.
Obj access can be completely unoptimized at first.
- Outline V0 system, IR instructions and changes required

Don't forget arrays...
- Special array element type value in each shape level
- Operation for writing to an array element, updating this type

Objects are usually constructed. Actions should probably be:
- Add a new property, with a name
  - May want to combine with set type
  - Otherwise, what is the initial type? un-init?
- Delete a property
- Set some attributes on a property (bit set)
- For getter/setters, set the property value, then set the attrib bits
- Set a property's type?
  - Only needed if the current type doesn't match, is not a subtype

Should this build a "shape tree"?
- Deletion is a problem
- A system with a global shape signature string and lookup might be best?
  - Still take addition order into account
- Want transitions to be fast

Need to fit types into this ***
- setProp(name, type)
- Probably best to have a setType operation that is separate
- Types go from specific to general, eventually any

Idea of a shape tree is not bad... Could eventually have some "shapeless"
dictionary objects for trees that are too deep. Not necessary for now.
- Hence each action moves us down the tree
- ISSUE: global object may have a long-ass tree?
  - Can probably deal with it... Could orphan its tree since it's a singleton

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Eddy: property attributes are stored as a set of bit flags
(for the configurable, enumerable, and writable flags),
and pointers (for getters and setters) for each shape.

Eddy: Each shape also has a base shape, which is used to store information
that is often the same for each shape. Among other things, the base shape is
used to store the above fields. So, for instance, two properties with
different names, but the same attributes, would have two shapes
(storing the name), both of which point to the same base shape
(storing the attributes).

If you're interested in the details, here's a link to the source code.
It's fairly well commented, so it might be useful to you:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notion of types: 
- type tag
- objects: which shape id
- closures: which closure

TODO: study shape implementation in FF, look at slides, look at source
- ask about multiple successive transitions, constructors

TODO: think about shapes more
- guaranteed minimum object size
  - ext table for extra properties
- how complicated would they be to implement in a basic form?
  - switch to shape idx
- start writing D code for shapes
  - class ObjShape
- no more "make_map"
- getters/setters
- no more "missing" value?
- array elem prop

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*** Need to skech out implementation, runtime code ***
Think about shape representation and implementation in detail

Moz people use a tree, with many special cases
- Creation site not accounted for, properties added in order
- Operations make us transition to new shapes in a tree structure of shapes
- Operations
  - Write value of some given type to property k
  - set property attribs
  - install getter/setter
  - those could possibly all be special cases of write value?
    - maybe not, can set attribs without setting value?

Getters-setters:
- Fast access speed not necessarily critical
- Main goal is to eliminate overhead for normal property accesses
- Get/set doesn't have an index/offset into objects?
  - Probably still needs to be stored in there? Otherwise stored in the map

Probably want to move the proto lookup logic into some readProp instruction?
- Less logic in JS, generate more compact assembly
- Need to bail out of there is the property is a getter/setter
  - instr can return a closure ptr if this is the case?
