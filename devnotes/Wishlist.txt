TODO: blog post, Higgs' Fancy New Object System => get started
- use knightmare image for featured image
- quick sketching program, online?
- post to r/compilers, r/higgsjs
- Typed shapes + BBV a bit of a gamble

TODO: blog post, the future of compilation
- Logical reasoning, supercompilation
- JIT compilers, continuous of compilation
- Lazyness is crucial
- Definite place for controlled code duplication
TODO: BBV - Hindsight & Future Directions
- Check notes

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TODO: optimize x86 instr encoding based on usage
- e.g.: reg64 to mem move and vice versa?
- do profiling first

TODO: produce 32-bit offsets/addresses in CodeBlock.toString

TODO: execHeap collection/expansion
- Marc says: not on critical path for paper

TODO: arrays, functions, have obj ptr inside, drop object inheritance system
- Arrays: how do we handle resizing, use a next pointer? Store length
  - Need to check elem < length anyways before reading?

TODO: typed arrays
- Will save many many type checks on some benchmarks
  - e.g. : integer, FFT

TODO: look at https://github.com/dntj/jsfft
- Do they have a test/benchmark of the FFT?

FIXME: string concat is very slow right now... can we make it faster?
- slow benchmarks: string-base64, string-fasta, splay
- can we get the offset of the string data? str_ofs_data(s, 0)
- create a memcpy IR instr?
    import std.c.string;
    memcpy ( void * destination, const void * source, size_t num );
    issue: spilling required
    could generate custom code

TODO: block-internal jumps, can they all fit in 8-bit indices? force?
- can maybe "promise" it will fit

TODO: val can be both in reg and stack

TODO: transform jit.compileUnit into jit.execUnit
- Do parsing, AST->IR and call in there, better time accounting?
- Any real reason not to?
- alternative: try to treat unit functions more like other functions
  - create closure objects for them
  - create some sort of closure call bridge with a C call conv
  - having a "C adapter" for a specific closure seems sensible

TODO: add tests for nested eval support
- accessing local vars, changing vars
TODO: implement full eval support
- eval can be called as global eval or local eval
  - different "eval context"
- if direct/local eval possible, function must behave as if all locals could be captured
  - graft new IR sub-function into parent? don't add to sub list, but have parent link set
- parse AST, optionally set parent link, run AST vars pass
  - may want to pass a parent ptr to AST parsing function
- eval_str function needs to find who the caller is, determine if direct call?
  - call instr to get_global "eval"
  - VM.getCallInstr?
- need to "ungraft" the AST after vars analysis?
- PROBLEM: there's no parent pointer in AST nodes
  - can't just run vars analysis on subfunction, need to rerun the whole thing...

TODO: look into jetstream benchmarks
https://www.webkit.org/blog/3418/introducing-the-jetstream-benchmark-suite/

TODO: complete WAV output support, test it out with sine wave

TODO: take a break, look into sound output
- work on this in dev-maxime branch ***
- look at existing code
  - can write and wait for poll, no callback

TODO: higgs shebang mode?
- first js file arg has shebang line

TODO: port CSG lib
http://evanw.github.io/csg.js/

TODO: alloc global VM in 32-bit ptr space?
- Ask how on D forums, maybe tweet link
- Look into addressing modes required, mov encodings
TODO: alloc code heap in 32-bit space?
- Would this benefit us? where are 64-bit code ptrs?

TODO: think about inlining system further
- Necessary for acceptable compile times
- Can fully optimize primitives, avoid needing code-patching
- Make an exception for units with loops also
- do it intelligently, don't inline in runtime fns, or if too deep in stack?
TODO: gather stats about the percentage of functions which are long-running
- init is almost 2x as fast compile time with noinline
  - compile time for 3d-raytrace less than half, same for turtle
- disable inlining first
- dump text and sort
  - fn, num calls, num itrs

TODO: make $ runtime/stdlib variables read-only, non-enumerable, non-configurable

TODO: const globals
const name1 = value1 [, name2 = value2 [, name3 = value3 [, ... [, nameN = valueN]]]];
- Same structure as var decl
- In D8, these are enumerable
- Use it for Turing Turtle
- Look at current parser code, vars code, ast-to-ir code first ***

TODO: look at eval notes again

When fine-tuning the S9 garbage collector (which also is a constant-space mark-and-sweep collector),
maintaining 50% of free space turned out to be the sweet spot. Whenever less than
50% of free space are available after a collection, the heap grows.
=> grow on next GC

TODO: liveness analysis flipped...?
- TODO: start by implementing system to measure total liveness analysis time
  - test on 3d-raytrace, other big benchmarks which don't GC, find slowest
- Current pathological cases, live sets grow very big everywhere
  - Many many large sets, independently allocated
- Idea:
  - For some values, big live intervals
  - Most values, vast majority, tiny live intervals
  - For a given value, store the places where it's live in a set
- Use custom set data structure to store live interval
  - small embedded list
  - associative array, initially empty
  - For most values, small embedded list will work
- Values that are never live don't even have a live set

TODO: constant prop in ValType?
- Don't have to propagate all
- Would be useful to prop shapes without using a register
- Propagate booleans
- Simplify shape_is_null and such

class AstNode: public ZoneObject
class InstructionOperand : public ZoneObject
typedef ZoneVector<InstructionOperand*> InstructionOperandVector;
// The Zone supports very fast allocation of small chunks of
// memory. The chunks cannot be deallocated individually, but instead
// the Zone supports deallocating all chunks in one fast
// operation. The Zone is used to hold temporary data structures like
// the abstract syntax tree, which is deallocated after compilation.
std.conv:
T emplace(T, Args...)(void[] chunk, auto ref Args args) if (is(T == class));
// AST nodes are allocated in a separate zone, which allows faster
// allocation and constant-time deallocation of the entire syntax
// tree.
- Free list approach: fast reallocation, but still need to allocate many
  objects. D GC will still prove extremely slow.
- Seems we really should allocate our own large memory blocks
  - Must call addRange on the memory range
  - Free list: maybe use a vector, no need to inherit from PoolObject?
http://wiki.dlang.org/Memory_Management#Explicit_Class_Instance_Allocation
- Use @nogc attribute

TODO: synth, right for new synth, up for new melody
- log the melody
TODO: try allowing either tri or sine in osc bank
TODO: grid sequencer, keyboard movement to select current square
- pentatonic scale a different color but other notes available

TODO: try to implement inline array for instr args, phi args

TODO: Can we free one scr reg to reduce spills? May help nbody
- who uses scrRegs[2]?

TODO: getter and setter syntax
- needed for hash map benchmark
- Easy to recognize the grammar, but need to modify the AST
  - Use a struct for object literal property descriptors
- Probably want some kind of runtime call to define getters and setters

FP machine
- x and y inputs, in [-1, 1]
- function to compute an output from input coordinates
- iterative computation, fixed itr count
- table of operators to compute each variable
  - input variables are fixed

Octree rendering, CSG carving?
- Once you get small enough you can draw simple points
- How fast could we make this, how little code?
- All axis-aligned
- Add volume (color), subtract volume
- Reuse GL matrix/camera code

TODO: Higgs is a Typed Architecture
- Presentation, argument, angry guy, red face
  - Photo
- Link to repr classic paper
- Drawing
- Optimization
- Links to source
- Reg alloc and future


















[DONE] TODO: not missing global prop opt?
- observation: if read once, we know its not missing

[DONE] TODO: accelerate getPropObj, make more hosted?
- generate optimized machine code? inline cache?

[DONE] TODO: proper hidden classes, support for property enumeration?
- Type information in hidden classes too?

[DONE] Idea: getters/setters + never used opt?
- Need to be able to invalidate code depending on this
- segregate by property name, much more effective

[DONE] TODO: lib/plot using image lib
- look into terminology
- look into how matplotlib does it
- short blog post, bitcoin
- demo plotting stock data
  - bitcoin price CSV?
- plot.graph(width, height, points, xFirst, xLast, yMin, yMax)
  - but this will only draw one function
  - can be OK to start
- need to be able to update the plots over time
  - plot functions should take a window object to draw into

[DONE] TODO: pixel plotting, drawing window lib? lib/draw
- Probably will want to use X11
  - implement a lib/x11
  - need an event loop
- Can have a draw lib which creates a window using lib/x11 and sets up a
  basic event loop
  - allows setting callbacks for KB and mouse events
  - allows calling a function in the loop
- Make another lib to read from the console without blocking
  - use select() on stdin
  - Can then implement our own REPL on top
  - not a priority for now, don't need REPL to implement games and such
