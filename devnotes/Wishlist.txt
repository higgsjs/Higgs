--------

TODO: add --jit_trace command-line option

TODO: complete WAV output support, test it out with sine wave

TODO: optimize x86 instr encoding based on usage
- e.g.: reg64 to mem move and vice versa?
- do profiling first

Idea: global table of property names with type monitoring
- current index, if always same
- current type
- can it be a getter/setter?
- discuss with Marc
  - would most probably work well for benchmarks
- if foobar property always has same offset, don't even care what the map is
  - fair game?
- issue: can know that x is always at some index, but doesn't mean that your
  object has a property x
- can do monitoring per-map, and get great perf gains on the global object
- how often are object types monomorphic?

Idea: getters/setters + never used opt?
- Need to be able to invalidate code depending on this
- segregate by property name, much more effective

TODO: produce 32-bit offsets/addresses in CodeBlock.toString

TODO: reduce code size by using calls for fallback code,
eg: global access, call_prim inlining/recompilation, others?

TODO: proper hidden classes, support for property enumeration?
- Type information in hidden classes too?

TODO: execHeap collection/expansion
- Marc says: not on critical path for paper

TODO: arrays, functions, have obj ptr inside, drop object inheritance system
- Arrays: how do we handle resizing, use a next pointer? Store length
  - Need to check elem < length anyways before reading?

TODO: typed arrays
- Will save many many type checks on some benchmarks
  - e.g. : integer, FFT

TODO: think about type representation
- types need to encode obj vs clos vs array
- typed arrays: int32 array, float array
- use one whole word for cst value, encode map idx in there too?

TODO: have map idx system, instead of map pointers?
- smaller comparison instr
- avoids issue of maps reallocated at same addr
- smaller type representation
- what else?

TODO: accelerate getPropObj, make more hosted?
- generate optimized machine code? inline cache?

TODO: look at https://github.com/dntj/jsfft
- Do they have a test/benchmark of the FFT?

FIXME: string concat is very slow right now... can we make it faster?
- slow benchmarks: string-base64, string-fasta, splay
- can we get the offset of the string data? str_ofs_data(s, 0)
- create a memcpy IR instr?
    import std.c.string;
    memcpy ( void * destination, const void * source, size_t num );
    issue: spilling required
    could generate custom code

TODO: block-internal jumps, can they all fit in 8-bit indices? force?
- can maybe "promise" it will fit

TODO: blog post about draw lib
- advice: crazy but true titles, skimmable blog posts, skimmable style, pretty pics
- tutorials, should also list in wiki, or blog wiki tuts?

TODO: pixel plotting, drawing window lib? lib/draw
- Probably will want to use X11
  - implement a lib/x11
  - need an event loop
- Can have a draw lib which creates a window using lib/x11 and sets up a
  basic event loop
  - allows setting callbacks for KB and mouse events
  - allows calling a function in the loop
- Make another lib to read from the console without blocking
  - use select() on stdin
  - Can then implement our own REPL on top
  - not a priority for now, don't need REPL to implement games and such
