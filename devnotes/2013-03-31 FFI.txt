The eventual goal is to give users of Higgs easy access to various APIs.
We will probably want to provide access to standard C APIs such as
malloc/free as well as the C file APIs. May also want to provide BSD-type
sockets, OpenGL, keyboard/mouse input, audio output. We could possibly
try to recruit some help (e.g.: on reddit) to implement some of these APIs
once our FFI system is in a more mature state.

Other layers of abstraction can be built to simplify the user experience 
further. For example, I would really like to have a drawing/canvas API that
allows the user to plot pixels using only a few simple commands, such as:

// Loads the canvas library
load('libs/canvas.js'); 

// Creates a window, title is optional
w = new CanvasWindow(512, 512);

// Draws a red pixel
w.setPixel(100, 200, {r:255, g:0, b:0});

Such a canvas API could be built on top of the OpenGL library API. In the
example above, the regular JS load command is used to load our library. The
same could be done for OpenGL or file acess:

// Loads a wrapper for the C stdio API
load('libs/stdio.js');

f = fopen('foobar', 'r');
...

Some libraries may not be usable on all systems. For example, audio APIs, or
even OpenGL (may not be installed). If the wrappers fail to load, an exception
should be thrown. This exception can be caught by the user code.

I'm proposing we create a higgs/source/libs directory to store JS files
implementing various libraries/bindings we want to provide to users. Some of
these libraries can be handwritten (e.g.: canvas), others like OpenGL could
eventually be auto-generated by a C header parsing tool, but we could also
write the initial JS bindings by hand based on our low-level C FFI or wrappers
around the low-level C FFI.

To make all this practical, I think we should probably get rid of the
BIN_DIR makefile option and instead implement a "make install" build target.
This would compile Higgs and copy the binary under /usr/bin/higgs, and copy the
higgs/source/stdlib and higgs/source/libs directories under /etc/higgs.
When executing the load() command, higgs would first look in the current
directory by default, and then under /etc/higgs if the path is relative. This
would ensure that our libraries remain usable no matter the current directory.
