TODO: all libs
      - cleaner API designs
      - perf also needs to be a consideration; all apis/libs should be designed so that it's easy to do
        common tasks in a performant way. Try to achieve best balance possible.

TODO: test lib
      - more assertion/helper functions

TODO: improve FFI
      - keep improving error messages/checking
      - add toString() and toJS() functionality for structs/unions
      - improved wrapping
      - wrapAll() function?
      - add some preprocessor functionality?

TODO: SDL bindings
      X move to binding for SDL2? Not as much support currently, but more future proof
      - [STARTED] SDL2 bindings

TODO: Xlib
      - bindings for Xlib
      - [STARTED] currently just covering enough to be useful to SDL, cairo, etc
      
TODO: cairo bindings
      - [STARTED] currently just covering enough to be useful to drawing lib
      
TODO: dawing lib
      - [STARTED]
      - simple drawing api for drawing to windows/images/pdf

TODO: stdlib
      - improve stdlib

TODO: docs
      - more documentation needed all around

TODO: dir lib
      - add functionality / settle api
      - add more predicate functions - isFile etc

TODO: higgs-mode
      - higgs (minor?) mode for emacs, prototype complete
      - get prototype up on github
      - add REPL capability
      - higgs-dev functionality - run make targets, etc
      - addons for js-mode and js2-mode to get correct syntax coloring, autocomplete, etc behavior for
        Higgs globals (such as require()) and IR function names, etc.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[DONE]: improve FFI
      - better errors in cdef - just good enough to find problems
      - add more wrapping capability
      - performance improvements (more caching/sharing, etc internally)
      - add caching for bindings created by cdef to avoid reparsing, eval(), etc each time?

[DONE]: test lib
      X more assert/testing functions
      X basic assert functions; exit abnormally on failure

[DONE]: test harness
      - simple harness for running tests similar to what mozilla uses in their JIT tests

[DONE]: organize
      - merge in the ridic number of feature branches you got going on brah

[DONE]: start FFI

The eventual goal is to give users of Higgs easy access to various APIs.
We will probably want to provide access to standard C APIs such as
malloc/free as well as the C file APIs. May also want to provide BSD-type
sockets, OpenGL, keyboard/mouse input, audio output. We could possibly
try to recruit some help (e.g.: on reddit) to implement some of these APIs
once our FFI system is in a more mature state.

Other layers of abstraction can be built to simplify the user experience 
further. For example, I would really like to have a drawing/canvas API that
allows the user to plot pixels using only a few simple commands, such as:

// Loads the canvas library
load('libs/canvas.js'); 

// Creates a window, title is optional
w = new CanvasWindow(512, 512);

// Draws a red pixel
w.setPixel(100, 200, {r:255, g:0, b:0});

Such a canvas API could be built on top of the OpenGL library API. In the
example above, the regular JS load command is used to load our library. The
same could be done for OpenGL or file acess:

// Loads a wrapper for the C stdio API
load('libs/stdio.js');

f = fopen('foobar', 'r');
...

Some libraries may not be usable on all systems. For example, audio APIs, or
even OpenGL (may not be installed). If the wrappers fail to load, an exception
should be thrown. This exception can be caught by the user code.

I'm proposing we create a higgs/source/libs directory to store JS files
implementing various libraries/bindings we want to provide to users. Some of
these libraries can be handwritten (e.g.: canvas), others like OpenGL could
eventually be auto-generated by a C header parsing tool, but we could also
write the initial JS bindings by hand based on our low-level C FFI or wrappers
around the low-level C FFI.

To make all this practical, I think we should probably get rid of the
BIN_DIR makefile option and instead implement a "make install" build target.
This would compile Higgs and copy the binary under /usr/bin/higgs, and copy the
higgs/source/stdlib and higgs/source/libs directories under /etc/higgs.
When executing the load() command, higgs would first look in the current
directory by default, and then under /etc/higgs if the path is relative. This
would ensure that our libraries remain usable no matter the current directory.
