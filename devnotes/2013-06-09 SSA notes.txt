How hard would it be to switch to SSA?

1. Tweak/adapt IR
- Constant pool for int32s, float64s, true/false/null/undef/missing

2. Port/reimplement AST->IR
- No longer does slot mapping
- Now needs to build basic SSA graph (varmap, ...)
- Overall structure remains the same

3. Liveness and slot mapping analysis for new IR
- Needed for interpreter
- Instructions marked with their assigned slots
- Args get fixed slots as before
- Other instrs get slots based on who's live at the same time
  - Map instr to first slot that's not already mapped to an interfering value

4. Adapt interpreter
- Interpreter mostly doesn't care?
- Instructions have mapped output slots as before
- Phi nodes have mapped slots, do a move as necessary?
- The block who branches should do the SSA moves

4. Modify/remplement inlining for SSA
- Not too hard? Disable inlining at first

3. Rework JIT for new IR
- Instrs have slots mapped to them as before
- Try to use SSA info to generate better code
- Phi nodes? Normally would require moves
  - In version case, request version where phi node has current slot/reg

Do a git branch if you decide to do this ****

(12:16:44 AM) Mot Low: git branch branchname
(12:16:49 AM) Mot Low: then git checkout branch



IRValue class
- Instrs, constants, phi nodes

Blocks should have:
- list of preds
  - No list of succs, build into branch
- List of phi nodes
- List of instrs


IRInstr needs to have list of dsts
- Probably shouldn't try to be too clever and optimized at this stage?
- If dsts are linked lists of use objects, removal is automatic***
- Also never need to traverse this list, or only rarely


struct Use
{
    prev
    next
    value
    dst
}




Blocks with parameters?
- Entry has arguments as parameters, pre-mapped to slots
- For other blocks, params are the phi nodes
- Branches need to specify what value goes into what block argument?
  - Can have one block branch to the same target on true/false


block parameter objects need to be IRValues
- have dsts, have stackSlot
- have names
- pretty much phi nodes or args!












------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alternative:
- allow our IR instrs to have constant value args not mapped to slots
- use/def, def/use chains?

Kind of clunky, need re-analysis to update u/d d/u

; $12 = set_i32 32                      
mov ecx, 32;                            B9 20 00 00 00
; free rdx r11                          
; $12 = load_rawptr $34, $12            
mov edi, ecx;                           89 CF
mov rcx, [qword rbx + rdi];             48 8B 0C 3B
; free rdx r11                          

; $12 = eq_rawptr $12, $13              
cmp rcx, rdx;                           48 39 D1
mov ecx, 2;                             B9 02 00 00 00
mov edi, 1;                             BF 01 00 00 00
cmove ecx, edi;                         0F 44 CF
; free rdx r11                          
; if_true $12 => entry(C1DF), call_reg(C234)
cmp cl, 1;                              80 F9 01
jne CALL_REG(C234)(2392);               0F 85 B8 03 00 00
jmp ENTRY(C1DF)(1442);                  EB 00
; free rcx rdx r11                      

Conclusion: we are mostly screwed? The free reg info is unhelpful.

This would be trivial to optimize with SSA but really isn't here.
In SSA, we'd just generate better code in the first place. Right now, we're
trying to fix a problem post-hoc. Many inlining opts currently not possible. 
Redundant move elimination isn't even a problem with SSA.
